# Olist Ecommerce Analysis

## Project Background
Founded in 2015, Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that operates as a marketplace integrator. Unlike standalone marketplaces such as Amazon, Olist connects small and medium-sized businesses with major online sales channels like Amazon Brazil and Mercado Livre.

The platform provides a publicly available dataset of around 100,000 anonymized e-commerce orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset contains critical e-commerce data regarding customer and seller details, order records, customer reviews and geolocations. This project analyzes this data in order to uncover actionable insights and recommendations to improve performance across marketing, sales, product and finance teams. Regarding the previously mentioned categories, the analysis is focused on the following key metrics:

- **Customer Acquisition & Retention:** *"How do payment methods influence repeat purchase behavior, and which should we incentivize?"* 

- **Geographic Targeting:** *"Which regions have untapped demand for high-margin categories like Health/Beauty?"*  

- **Financial Risk Management:** *"Which payment methods correlate with cancellations/fraud, and how can we mitigate them?"* 

- **Delivery Performance & Customer Satisfaction:** *"Is there a relationship between delivery performance and review scores?"*

- **Quarterly Sales Trends:** *"How do revenue and AOV fluctuate seasonally, and how can we optimize campaigns or inventory around those peaks?"*
