# Olist Ecommerce Analysis

## Project Background
Founded in 2015, Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that operates as a marketplace integrator. Unlike standalone marketplaces such as Amazon, Olist connects small and medium-sized businesses with major online sales channels like Amazon Brazil and Mercado Livre.

The platform provides a publicly available dataset spanning 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. The dataset contains critical e-commerce data regarding customer and seller details, order records, customer reviews and geolocations. This project analyzes this data in order to uncover actionable insights and recommendations to improve performance across marketing, sales, product and finance teams. To improve performance across the previously mentioned categories, it was decided to focus on the following key metrics:

-__Customer Acquisition & Retention:__

-**Geographic Targeting:**

-**Financial Risk Management:**

-**Delivery Performance & Customer Satisfaction:**

-**Quarterly Sales Trends:**
